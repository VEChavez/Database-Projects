The following relational databases are for our capstone project, a web-based clinical documentation system. DocuData.sql handles the most of the system data, including patient information, IV fluid records, medication records, nurse notes, and more, while DocuData_Doctors.sql is specifically designed for storing doctors orders and medication orders. These two databases are interconnected, ensuring seamless data flow between them. Together, they contain over 40 tables, forming a well-structured and comprehensive system. This folder also includes the corresponding ERDs and DFDs. The databases were built using MariaDB and managed through phpMyAdmin. This folder also includes the corresponding DFDs up until level 2 and its ERDs as well.
